## The Game of Tennis 







Points – Smallest unit of measurement. Points increment from Love(0)-15-30-40-game.
Games – Games consist of 4 points each, and is won when a player reaches 4 points with at least a 2 point advantage.
Sets – A set consists of 6 games and is won by the player/team who reaches 6 games first with least a 2 point lead.
Advantage Set – If a game score of 6-6 is reached and advantage set rules are used, a player/team can only win a set with a 2 game lead.
Matches – A match is usually played as best of 3 or best of 5 sets.
Deuce – Occurs if a score of 40-40 is reached. In order to win the game, a player/team must win 2 consecutive points in order to take the game. If a player wins one point, they have advantage, but if they lose the next point, the score returns to deuce.
Tie-break game – If a game score of 6-6 is reached and tie-break set rules are used, players must play a tie-break game in order to decide who wins the set. In a tie-break game, a player/team must reach 7 points with a two point advantage to win. For the serving format of a tie-break game, player 1 serves for the first point, player 2 serves for the next two points, player 1 serves for the next two points after that, etc.

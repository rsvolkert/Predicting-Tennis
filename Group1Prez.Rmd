## Project 

- Based on a paper by Paul K. Newton and Joseph B. Keller called *Probability of Winning at Tennis 1. Theory and Data*

- Paper discussed how the probability of winning a game, a set, and a match in tennis are computed based on each player's probability of winning a point on a serve

- Based on other papers the conclusion was made to treat serves in tennis as independent identically distributed (iid) random variables

- It is noted that points in tennis are not iid for most purposes. This is not a bad assumption as the divergence from iid is small
  
- Both two out of three and three out of five set matches were considered allowing for 13-point tiebreaker in each set if needed
  
  
## The Rules of Tennis 

- Point: Smallest unit of measurement (Love-15-30-40-game)

- Game: A game is one when a player reaches 4 points with at least a 2 point advantage 

- Set: A set is won by the player who wins 6 games first

- Advantage Set: If a game score of 6-6 is reached and advantage set rules are used, a player can only win a set with a 2 game lead

- Matches: Best of 3 sets (for women) or 5 sets (for men)

- Tie-break game: If a game score of 6-6 is reached and tie-break set rules are used. In a tie-break game, a player/team must reach 7 points with a two point advantage to win

## Values

Things we need to know:

- Empirical probability of winning a rally on serve 

- Empirical probability of winning a game on serve  \pause


Things we need to calculate: 

- Theoretical probability of winning a game on serve

- Theoretical probability of winning a set

- Theoretical probability of winning the tie-breaker 

- Theoretical probability of winning a match



## Theoretical Probabilities: Rally and Game


$$\text{P(A Winning a Rally | A Served)} = p_A^R = \frac{\text{Points Won On Serve}}{\text{Points Served}}$$ \pause



$$\text{P(A Winning a Game | A Served)}$$
$$=p_A^G = (p_A^R)^4[1+4q_A^R+10(q_A^R)^2] +20(p_A^Rq_A^R)^3(p_A^R)^2[1-2p_A^Rq_A^R]^{-1}$$ 

- Where Probability A loses a rally given A served: 
$$q_A^R = 1-\frac{\text{Points Won On Serve}}{\text{Points Served}}$$


## Theoretical Probabilities: Set



$$ \text{P(A Winnning a Set | A Served)} $$
$$= p_A^S =\sum_{j=0}^4p_A^S(6,j) + p_A^S(7,5) + p_A^S(6,6)p_A^T$$ \pause

Where, $p_A^S(i,j)$ is defined recursively as: 

$p_A^S(0,0) = 1$, $p_A^S(i,j) = 0$ if $i<0$ or $j<0$. 

- if i+j -1 is even: $p_A^S(i,j) = p_A^S(i-1,j)p_A^G + p_A^S(i, j-1)q_A^G$

    - omit i-1 term if j=6 and i<6

    - omit j-1 term if i=6 and j<6


- if i+j -1 is odd: $p_A^S(i,j) = p_A^S(i-1,j)q_B^G + p_A^S(i, j-1)p_B^G$

    - omit i-1 term if j=6 and i<6

    - omit j-1 term if i=6 and j<6


## Theoretical Probabilities: Tie Breaker


$$\text{P(A Winning the Tie Breaker | A Served Initially)} $$
$$=p_A^T = \sum_{j=0}^5p_A^T(7,j) +  p_A^T(6,6)p_A^Rq_B^R[1 - p_A^Rp_B^R - q_A^Rq_B^R]^{-1}$$ \pause

Where,  $p_A^T(i,j)$ is defined recursively as: 

$p_A^T(0,0) = 1$, $p_A^T(i,j) = 0$ if i<0 or j<0. 

- if $i+j -1 \mod 4 \equiv 0 \; \text{or} \;3$: $p_A^S(i,j) = p_A^T(i-1,j)p_A^R + p_A^T(i, j-1)q_A^R$

    - omit i-1 term if j=7 and i<7

    - omit j-1 term if i=7 and j<7


- if $i+j -1 \mod 4 \equiv 1 \; \text{or} \; 2$: $p_A^T(i,j) = p_A^T(i-1,j)q_B^R + p_A^T(i, j-1)p_B^R$

    - omit i-1 term if j=7 and i<7

    - omit j-1 term if i=7 and j<7


## Theoretical Probabilities: Match 

Women's (Best of 3):
$$\text{P(A Winning the Match | A Served First)}$$
$$=p_A^M = (p_A^S)^2 + 2(p_A^S)^2p_B^S$$ \pause


Men's (Best of 5):
$$\text{P(A Winning the Match | A Served First)}$$ 
$$=p_A^M = (p_A^S)^3 + 3(p_A^S)^3p_B^S + 6(p_A^S)^3(p_B^S)^2$$

Where: 

- $p_A^S=\text{Probabilty A wins a set given A served}$

- $p_B^S=\text{Probabilty B wins a set given B served}$

  - Men and Women semifinalists in the 2002 U.S Open tournament 
  
  - Men and Women semifinalists in the 2002 Wimbledon tournament \pause
